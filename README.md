Registry Helper for Wizards Unite

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Things I did so the Google Sign-in would work:
- Added SHA1 on Firebase (from debug.keystore generated by Android Studio): keytool -list -v -keystore debug.keystore (no password)
- Put info on consent screen: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
